# What It Does
A finance management app for individuals who want to manage their monthly expenses. To use this app, a user need to sign up to sign in as this program remembers data by a "user id" to offer customized experiences. A user can save, edit and see the categorized graph representing the result of monthly expenses grouped by the user. In this app, we suggest 4 different categories such as Food, Housing, Clothing, and Misc.

# Tech Stacks
- MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js (MERN)
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -> Amplify
  
# Accomplishments we are proud of
We (a team of two students) encountered many bugs and there were things we didn't have any deep knowledge about since both of us are still learning. However, we endured the long debugging process and finally made this app properly work. 

# Challenges we ran into
The Back-End data manipulation part was not easy. We intended to return a category total of all expenses when a user types a new expense under a certain category, the data seemed lost and couldn't retrieve the total. After hours and hours of debugging, we found the reason why the app gives us a wrong output.

# Future Improvements
- AWS Amplify is not free to use after a certain trial duration, so we need to find another service to deploy for free
- Other complicated features such as AI agents would be added beyond the basic CRUD features for the expense calculation.
